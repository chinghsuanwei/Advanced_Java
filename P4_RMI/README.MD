It's really the last code I submit?

I test it.

There has bug the task is not shared between clients.

And RMI seems really works.

But /rexe t1 b(another user) is really works? Not sure

And /rexe t1 c(non-existent user) return the right result, so there should has issue in RMI

or It's right behavior?
